## About Me
I study Computer Science at UNCG and will graduate in fall 2026. I work as an Arabic teacher for the kids. I lived in Jordan and came to Greensboro when I was 21. I always loved learning about computers since I was a kid.


## My CSC340 Goals
In CSC 340, my goal is to strengthen my understanding of software engineering concepts and how they are applied in real-world projects. I want to improve my ability to work with Git and GitHub in a team environment, including collaborating through branches and pull requests.

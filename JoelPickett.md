## About Me
I am a sophomore on the Computer Science B.S. Degree path at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and plan to graduate next year. I work as a tutor in the Computer Science department and as a Teaching Assistant for CSC130. I'm also taking the Japanese language courses at UNCG and I would love for it to become a minor or double major for me, but currently that is not available.

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope, by taking CSC340, that I will know how to create things on a professional level and by using the tools of the industry. I'm particularly interested in using Git in not only an educational setting, but as a team as well.
